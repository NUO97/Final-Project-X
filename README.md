# Final-Project-X

We use [American College Scorecard](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/college-scorecard) as an origin dataset. We summarized useful information, such as SAT and ACT scores, into a new dataset. The reason we use this dataset to **evaluate and analyze** US colleges is because there are so many high school students who are willing to find a new way to explore colleges. By using Shiny app and Rstudio, we are able to apply interactive data visualization skills to show data. <br>
